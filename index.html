    <h1>PCIS and it's Goal</h1>
    <div class="abtme">
     <p>Prosper Career Independent Study (also known as PCIS), is an independent study program for Prosper ISD. Students focus their studies on a specific field that they are interested in and work with professionals in the field. My specific field of interest is Healthcare Law. Students will pick a mentor, who will guide them throughout the school year and teach them about skills in their specific field of interest. Throughout the course, you will be working to develop and refine a carefully articulated research profile, consisting of the student's research, written assignments, interviews, and observations. 
      PCIS's goal is to provide advanced academic students an opportuinity to conduct a self-directed, in-depth study of their topic of interest while also gaining real world experience under a mentor in their community.</p>
